# Carousel

Yeah, I know. Another carousel. Mostly for personal use so I don't have to spend 
a bunch of time troubleshooting some random one.

## So what does it do?
 - Responsive? Check.
 - Touch? Check.
 - CSS Transitions? Check.

## And you've tested in...?
 - Chrome 25
 - Firefox 19
 - Safari 6
 - iOS 6
 - IE9
 - More as soon as I get my hands on them.

## Disclaimer

I made this for my own use and make no promises about it working at all. Use at your own risk.
